## 1. SEO Research & Keyword Strategy

*The foundation of a high-converting page is selecting the right audience and understanding their intent, prioritizing keywords that drive revenue.*

| Item | Why It Matters | Best Practices | Common Mistakes | Enhancements |
|:-----|:---------------|:---------------|:----------------|:-------------|
| **Search Intent Analysis** | Determines user's underlying goal. Satisfying intent is critical for rankings and engagement. | Map content format to top-ranking pages. Create content that addresses user goal quickly. | Creating content matching phrase but not solving actual need. Ignoring device-based intent differences. | Semantic keyword clustering to fully address topic. |
| **Primary Keyword Selection** | Ensures page is discoverable for main search phrase. | Select keyword with adequate volume. Target consistently in core SEO elements. | Targeting irrelevant keywords. Focusing only on highly competitive broad terms. | Target long-tail, question-based keywords for higher conversions. |
| **Commercial/Transactional Focus** | These keywords are closest to conversion and require less content to rank. | Start at bottom of funnel (Most Aware). Focus on keywords relevant to core offer. | Being seduced by volume alone. Targeting generic informational keywords first. | Use prioritization system: relevance, intent, KD, CPC. |
| **Topical Authority** | Essential for competitive ranking. Helps Google understand your expertise. | Pick one core topic and dominate it. Create supporting assets for all subtopics. | Random content creation. Dabbling instead of complete coverage. | Use NLP tools to identify relevant micro-topics. |
| **Competitor Analysis** | Identifies rivals' strengths and weaknesses to outperform them. | Analyze top-ranking sites. Replicate successful strategies better. | Failing to check technical health against rivals. | Analyze supplementary content and missed keyword opportunities. |
| **Keyword Gaps/Clusters** | Find low-hanging fruit where current pages aren't fully relevant. | Analyze rankings positions 2-15 or 51-100. Splinter different-intent keywords to dedicated pages. | Making one page rank for multiple distinct intents. | Search for keywords with unique, specific intent. |

## 2. On-Page SEO & Content Quality

*On-page optimization ensures page structure and content align with how Google's algorithms understand and prioritize information.*

### 2A. Keyword Placement (The "Three Kings")

Target high-authority sources. | Neglecting link acquisition. Content alone won't rank competitive keywords. | Create linkable assets: proprietary data, infographics, free tools. |
